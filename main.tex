My name's Mahdi; I'd like to help you with the research project. 
Currently, I'm a last semester \& soon be a graduate student in 
Theoretical Economics at TeIAS. I've been researching Economics \& 
also coding previous three years at TeIAS. 
I ranked 79th in the nationwide university entrance examination 
for Master of Economics in 2019. In the same year
I graduated with B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from 
the Sharif University of Technology. 
I believe that my previous quantitative/mathematical skills, 
as well as my excellence in programming with Python, 
makes me the right candidate for the job.

In my last 3 years at TeIAS as a researcher/programmer, 
I worked with financial data about TSE. 
I also coded/modeled multiple search models in labor Economics 
with Julia to solve the value functions quantitatively. 
Additionally, I have experience in modeling DSGE models with Dynare/Matlab. 
Besides that, I have worked with various datasets
to manage, clean \& categorize them in the area of Finance.

I love research \& coding, especially in the area of Economics.
After graduation, I hope to work on research projects to strengthen 
my skills \& deepen my knowledge so I can apply for a Ph.D. in Economics 
at an excellent university.

Please review my CV for additional details regarding my expertise and
achievements. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further
clarification on my experience. I would love to meet with you and discuss the position in
detail.

\noindent Thank you for your consideration.
